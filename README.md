# DAU-ConvNet
Displaced Aggregation Units for Convolutional Networks from CVPR 2018 paper titled "Spatially-Adaptive Filter Units for Deep Neural Networks"

Self-contained DAU layer implementation (C++ and CUDA). Use this library to implement DAU layers in any deep learning frameworks.

## Caffe ##
We currently provide a Caffe implementation based on this code in https://github.com/skokec/DAU-ConvNet-caffe

## TensorFlow ## 
TensorFlow implementation is coming soon. Work in progress version can be found in https://github.com/VitjanZ/DAU-ConvNet
